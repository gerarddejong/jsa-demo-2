Java Cloud Demo 2 from my talk [Building your first Smart Contract with Ethereum and Solidity](http://j-sa.co/personnel/gerard-de-jong/) from [Java Cloud Conference](http://j-sa.co) 2018 in Johannesburg and Cape Town South Africa.

## Description

This is a basic Hello World exmaple of to help you deploy your first contract.

## Talk Description

Imagine being able to write your next employment contract as code! You get to create the conditions (if then, while true) that determine what happens and when. Why stop your employment contract? Rental agreements, insurance, car purchases, every type of agreement can be expressed in code and we’ll show you how to write them and deploy them on the block chain based Ethereum network. In this talk we explore what Smart Contracts are and how they make contract enforcement (lawyers) redundant in the same way that block chain based cryptocurrencies make banks redundant. We’ll also take a tour of the Solidity programming language and show you how to implement the right interfaces (it’s a lot like Java). Finally we’ll get into the details of how to execute your Smart Contract on your own Private Block Chain network and how to navigate Ethereum Nodes, Wallets and the Geth (Go Ethereum) Command Line Interface.

## Setup 

1. Make sure you've installed a copy of [ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli) and have it running.

2. Open ConferenceTicketSale.sol in the [Remix IDE](http://remix.ethereum.org/) and deploy the contract 

3. Play around to test the contract.
